## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I needed to do a lot of googling to complete this challenge, so i have become more proficient in searching for answers to questions on forums such as stack overflow. Using psuedo classes which I didnt know previously existed (such as :focus-within) has helped me to target elements in a cleaner way.

### Continued development

To utilise DRY coding as I feel that I am repeating myself in the .css file and also the .js file. Learn more about accessibility.
